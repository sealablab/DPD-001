# Overview

This module defines a comprehensive exception hierarchy for the Moku library. It provides specialized exception classes for handling various error conditions that may occur during Moku device operations, including connection issues, streaming errors, deployment failures, and invalid parameters.

> [!info] Key Dependencies
> - `Exception` (built-in) - Base Python exception class used as foundation for custom exceptions

# Classes

## MokuException

Base exception class for all Moku-specific exceptions. All custom Moku exceptions inherit from this class, making it easy to catch any Moku-related error.

```python
class MokuException(Exception):
    """Base class for other Exceptions"""
    pass
```

> [!note] Implementation Notes
> This is the root exception in the Moku exception hierarchy. Use this in try-except blocks to catch any Moku-related error.

## StreamException

Raised when an error occurs during data streaming operations.

```python
class StreamException(MokuException):
    """Error occurred while streaming the data"""
    pass
```

## MokuNotFound

Raised when the system cannot locate a Moku device with the specified name or serial number.

```python
class MokuNotFound(MokuException):
    """Unable to find Moku with given name/serial."""
    pass
```

> [!warning] Important
> This exception is thrown during device discovery and connection attempts when the target device cannot be found on the network.

## IncompatibleMokuException

Base exception class for incompatibility-related issues.

```python
class IncompatibleMokuException(Exception):
    """Base class for other Exceptions"""
    pass
```

> [!note] Implementation Notes
> Note that this inherits from `Exception` directly, not from `MokuException`, creating a separate exception hierarchy branch.

## IncompatiblePackageException

Raised when the client package version is older than the version running on the Moku device.

```python
class IncompatiblePackageException(Exception):
    """Version of Client pakage is older then the version it is talking to"""
    pass
```

> [!warning] Important
> This indicates a version mismatch that may cause compatibility issues. Update the client package to resolve.

## NoPlatformBitstream

Raised when the required platform bitstream cannot be found.

```python
class NoPlatformBitstream(MokuException):
    """Cannot find platform bitstream"""
    pass
```

## NoInstrumentBitstream

Raised when the required instrument bitstream cannot be located.

```python
class NoInstrumentBitstream(MokuException):
    """Cannot find Instrument bitstream"""
    pass
```

## NetworkError

Raised when an unexpected network error occurs during communication with the Moku device.

```python
class NetworkError(MokuException):
    """Unexpected network error occurred"""
    pass
```

## DeployException

Raised when an instrument cannot be started, typically due to licensing restrictions or deployment failures.

```python
class DeployException(MokuException):
    """Couldn't start instrument. Moku may not be licenced to use that instrument"""
    pass
```

> [!warning] Important
> This may indicate that the Moku device does not have a valid license for the requested instrument.

## OperationNotFound

Raised when attempting to call a function that doesn't exist, often due to version incompatibilities.

```python
class OperationNotFound(MokuException):
    """Couldn't find valid function. May be due to incompatible versions"""
    pass
```

## InvalidParameterException

Raised when a parameter has an invalid type or value for the requested operation.

```python
class InvalidParameterException(MokuException):
    """Invalid parameter type or value for this operation"""
    pass
```

## InvalidRequestException

Raised when a request specifies an invalid instrument configuration.

```python
class InvalidRequestException(MokuException):
    """A request for an invalid instrument configuration has been made."""
    pass
```

## UnexpectedChangeError

Raised when an unexpected change occurs in the system state.

```python
class UnexpectedChangeError(MokuException):
    """A request has been made for data but none will be generated"""
    pass
```

> [!note] Implementation Notes
> Despite the docstring mentioning data generation, the class name suggests this is used for unexpected state changes.

## NoDataException

Raised when data is requested but none will be generated by the current configuration.

```python
class NoDataException(MokuException):
    """A request has been made for data but none will be generated"""
    pass
```

## InvalidParameterRange

Raised when a parameter value is not within the allowed range or set of values.

```python
class InvalidParameterRange(MokuException):
    """Parameter value is not one of the allowed values"""
    pass
```
