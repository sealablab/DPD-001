# 20251127-TODO

Claude, In this session I want to try out the 'taches-cc-resources' plugin I just installed from the market place. Keep that in mind with the following goals for this session

## P1: review [volo_bram_loader](volo_bram_loader.vhd)
**volo_bram_loader** is a simple, working BRAM loader I previously wrote with the following in mind:
- We can send arbitrary buffers into the bitstream over the network by using the networked control registers
- if we do this before we handoff to the 'main' application, we can design said application with the simple assumption that they have access to one or more 4K BRAM buffers that are properly initialized before startup.

The current implementation utilizes CR10-CR14 as the 'network loading' registers, but this is an arbitrary restriction, as we expect the network loading phase to take place before any handoff to the 'actual' bitstream.

## P2: 'campaign mode' RTL definition [DPD-RTL](rtl/DPD-RTL.yaml) 

We are going to use the aforementioned bram loader so that the python client code can send over one or more intensity look up tables. 

### Intensity LUT
colloquially speaking, I think we should create an 'IntensityLut' datatype with the following characteristics.
### 16-bit `signed1 tables with 7-bit indexes
- an intensity lut has indexes 0 through 100 
- LUT[0] -> 0x0000 (zero percent)
- LUT[1] -> ?? (one percent)
- LUT[5] -> ?? five percent
- LUT[100] -> 100 percent 


> [!NOTE] 100 percent should be <= `3v3` as an upper bound


## P3: [dpd_config](tests/lib/dpd_config.py) update
We want to be sure our handy 'dpd_config' file contains the resulting updates
## P4: [api-v4](docs/api-v4.md) update
we also need to update our api reference.
