# `.cursor/` Directory

This directory contains **Cursor-specific** configurations that are not part of the standard VS Code/Cursor shared settings.

## Contents

- **`keybindings.json`** - Custom keybindings (Cursor-specific workflow preferences)
- **`DPD-001.code-workspace`** - Workspace file (if you need multi-root workspace features)
- **`WORKSPACE-vs-DIRECTORY.md`** - Documentation about workspace vs directory approach

## Note

**Baseline settings** (editor, file explorer, language settings, etc.) are stored in **`.vscode/settings.json`** so they work in both VS Code and Cursor.

Only Cursor-specific customizations (like special keybindings) are kept here.
