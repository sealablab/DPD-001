# UNI-OSC-START

## Overview
@JC: Keep track of your implementations to the terminal oscilloscope rendering widget here.
NOTE: This __might__ actually be a really good use of git worktrees to enable quick iterations on two midly indpendent features. (We can work on the terminal renderer bugs/quirks while not really depending on the hardware being ready to communicate.) In faact this might make integrating everything easier overall. Maybe I will divide my day into two different sessions to work on these..

First i should definitely do the hardware though. I need something to synthesize. This will also take more concrete focus.
